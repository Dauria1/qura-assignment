## Technologies
 - React
 - Redux
 - Redux-Saga: Being that you guys use Sagas today and I have experience with them I figured it would be wise to show I can use sagas
 - BiomeJS: Something I have been wanting to try. So far so good. It seems a lot more straightforward and convient than eslint + prettier
 - PNPM: I prefer `pnpm` over `yarn` and `npm` for speed, less room taken on your local machine, built in nvm, etc
 - React-bootstrap: For something this simple, I don't see the use for writing my own CSS/components
